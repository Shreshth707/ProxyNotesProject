## For the Apk refer to the "Apk File" folder in the repository 
I have made the Application according to the requirements and in addition I have added few floating buttons in the main like the like button,the userprofile, subscribe and share button. All of them show response when pressed except the share button beacuse I havent added the share functionality yet.
This is an Android Application that uses SwipeViews to load different videos and is controled by onTouch gestures
